The Foundations of Languages and Machines Lab at MIT is led by [Rachit Nigam][rachit]. We build new programming languages, compilers, and tools to design fast hardware quickly and correctly.
We have a strong emphasis on building real tools, getting them used by industrial collaborators, and engaging with the process of building correct and high-performance hardware ourselves.

> **We are looking for new students to join our lab starting in Fall '25!** Please read the specific instruction (**TK**) on the application before reaching out.

## Projects

### Redesigning the RTL Abstraction
The register transfer level abstraction used by hardware description languages like Verilog is plagued with many problems. How can we do better?

### Automatic Hardware Generation
There has been substantial interest in automatically generating hardware from high-level specifications the existing languages are not very expressive or correct. Can we do better?
