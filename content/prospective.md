Thanks for your interest! Please read the instructions carefully before reaching out:

## PhD Students

Admission to MIT's PhD program is through the [EECS department][eecs-app]. When submitting your application, mention my name in your statement of purpose to make sure that I will read your application.

**Can I email you?** In general, I receive too many external student emails to respond to each one individually. I am more likely to respond to emails if they do one or more of the following:

- Demonstrate understanding of one of my research projects and:
	- Propose specific ideas to extend the work to address a limitation.
	- Connect ideas in my papers to other, unexplored directions.
- Demonstrate ability to build real, open-source projects *in my areas of interest* (programming languages, compilers, tools for hardware design):
	- A substantial extension to a class project building a compiler or a complex hardware accelerator.
	- Contributions to large open-source projects like [LLVM][] or [CIRCT][].
- Describe a primary-author publication at a top venue in programming languages, computer architecture, systems, or reconfigurable computing.
    - This is generally a high bar to achieve, and, in general, I do not expect people to have published a paper before joining the lab.

Emails like this can be a good jumping off point to have a technical conversation and might have a positive impact on your application since it provides extra signals that we have a compatible research tastes.

**Can you assess my application?** No. The strength of an application depends on the assessment of your letter writers which you do not have access to. Furthermore, the decision to accept any particular student is made with the input of several other faculty.
Please apply to the MIT graduate admissions process and list me as a reader for your application.

**Can you help me with my application?** No. However, [MIT's GAAP][gaap] provides assistance to students applying to MIT.


## MIT Students

### UROPs

Please drop me [an email][rachit-email] using your MIT address and tell me what got you excited about research! If you're a junior or senior student, please describe a research paper you've read and why you think I would a good match for you.

### M.Eng

If you would like to do a thesis project with me, please read two of my papers and [email me][rachit-email] propose a possible project you'd be interested in pursuing.
This does not need to be the final project you work on but should be a jumping off point for ideas.

### PhD

I love hearing what folks at MIT are working on! Drop me [an email][rachit-email], and we'll set up some time to chat.

## Postdocs

I am generally not accepting postdoc applications.
However, if you think we are an *exceptionally good* match, please:
1. Drop me an email with a concise description of your research and what projects you would like to pursue at FLAME.
2. Ask your advisor to email me with a letter of recommendation.
